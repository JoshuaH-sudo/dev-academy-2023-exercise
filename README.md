## Introduction
My solution for the Solita dev academy 2023 exercise.

Throughout this repo I have included various READMEs to explain my decisions and challenges I had while working on this exercise.

### Debrief
This assignment was really fun, I enjoyed being able to apply all my knowledge and skills I have acquired from my career and from my various personal projects, while learning some new skills like using Jest for testing and Figma for UI/UX designing. 

## Features
- All required and additional requirements of the exercise.
- Figma designs for each major UI component.
